# Web Development Project 4 - *Cat Discovery*

Submitted by: **Alexandra Sanzare**

This web app: **Cat Discovery utilizes the Cat API that displays cat images with their characteristics such as their breed and age. The user is able to view the history of the cat's they have seen and can add specific cat attributes to a ban list so those characteristics will not show up again in the future.**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session
